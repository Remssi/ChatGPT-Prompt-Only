# Wrap our App in react router

Sure, here's an example of how you could wrap your App component in react-router:

tsx
Copy code

```
import React from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Switch, Route } from 'react-router-dom';

import Home from './components/Home';
import Question from './components/Question';
import NotFound from './components/NotFound';

const App: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Switch>
        <Route exact path="/" component={Home} />
        <Route exact path="/question/:id" component={Question} />
        <Route component={NotFound} />
      </Switch>
    </Router>
  );
};

export default App;
```

In this version, we've imported BrowserRouter, Switch, and Route from react-router-dom. We've then defined three routes: one for the home page (/), one for individual questions (/question/:id), and one for any other route (which will render the NotFound component).

We've used the exact prop on the first two routes to ensure that they only match if the path is an exact match.

Finally, we've wrapped the entire Switch component in a Router component to provide the necessary routing context to all child components.
