# Show Question components as a grid with 3 columns in Home component

Sure! To display the Question components in a grid with 3 columns, you can use the CSS grid layout. Here's an example of how you could update the Home component to display the Question components in a grid:

tsx
Copy code

```
import React from 'react';
import Header from './Header';
import Footer from './Footer';
import Question from './Question';
import { HomeProps } from '../types';

const Home: React.FC<HomeProps> = ({ questions }) => {
  return (
    <>
      <Header />
      <div style={{ padding: '1rem' }}>
        <h1>Most Recent Questions</h1>
        <div style={{ display: 'grid', gridTemplateColumns: 'repeat(3, 1fr)', gap: '1rem' }}>
          {questions.map((question) => (
            <Question key={question.id} title={question.title} description={question.description.substring(0, 100)} id={question.id} />
          ))}
        </div>
      </div>
      <Footer />
    </>
  );
};

export default Home;
```

In this example, we've added a div element around the Question components and set its display property to grid. We've also used grid-template-columns to specify the number of columns and their width. In this case, we're using repeat(3, 1fr) to create 3 equal-width columns. We've also added gap to specify the spacing between the columns.

You can adjust the values of grid-template-columns and gap to customize the grid layout to your liking.
