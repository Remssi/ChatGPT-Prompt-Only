# Create NotFound component that is imported in App component

Sure! Here's an example of a simple NotFound component that you can import into your App component:

tsx
Copy code

```
import React from 'react';

const NotFound: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>404 - Not Found</h1>
      <p>The page you are looking for does not exist.</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default NotFound;
```

This component simply renders an h1 element with a "404 - Not Found" message and a p element with a description of the error. You can import this component into your App component and use it as a fallback route for any unrecognized URLs.
