# Can you apply font to the application that is less sharp edged than Times New Roman?

Yes, you can apply a font to your application that is less sharp-edged than Times New Roman by using the font-family CSS property. Here's an example of how you could update the font family for the entire application by adding a CSS rule to the index.css file:

css
Copy code

```
body {
  font-family: "Open Sans", sans-serif;
}
```

In this example, we're setting the font-family property of the body element to "Open Sans", sans-serif. "Open Sans" is the name of the font we want to use, and sans-serif is a fallback font in case the first font is not available.

You can replace "Open Sans" with any other font you prefer. There are many free fonts available on websites such as Google Fonts (https://fonts.google.com/) that you can use in your application. Just make sure to include the font in your project and specify it in the font-family property.
