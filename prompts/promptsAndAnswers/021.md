# Add Header and Footer to not found page

Sure! Here's an example of how you could add the Header and Footer components to the NotFound page:

tsx
Copy code

```
import React from 'react';
import Header from './Header';
import Footer from './Footer';

const NotFound: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <Header />
      <div style={{ textAlign: 'center', padding: '2rem' }}>
        <h1>Page Not Found</h1>
        <p>The page you're looking for doesn't exist.</p>
      </div>
      <Footer />
    </>
  );
};

export default NotFound;
```

We've imported the Header and Footer components and added them before and after the div element that displays the "Page Not Found" message.

Make sure that the Header and Footer components are imported and used in any other pages or components where you want them to appear.
