# Can you make the Footer always stick to bottom of screen+

Yes, we can use CSS flexbox to make the Footer component always stick to the bottom of the screen.

Here's an updated Footer component with CSS styles to achieve this:

tsx
Copy code

```
import React from 'react';

const Footer: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <footer style={{
      backgroundColor: '#eee',
      padding: '1rem',
      textAlign: 'center',
      position: 'fixed',
      bottom: 0,
      left: 0,
      right: 0,
    }}>
      <p style={{ margin: 0 }}>Â© 2023 My Q&A App. All rights reserved.</p>
    </footer>
  );
};

export default Footer;
```

We've added the following styles to the footer element:

position: fixed to make it fixed to the viewport and not scroll with the content
bottom: 0 to position it at the bottom of the viewport
left: 0 and right: 0 to make it span the entire width of the viewport
With these styles, the Footer component will always stick to the bottom of the screen, regardless of how much content there is on the page.
