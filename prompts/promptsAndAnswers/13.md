# Create example props for QuestionPage component

Sure, here is an example of what QuestionPageProps might look like:

tsx
Copy code

```
interface QuestionPageProps {
  question: {
    id: number;
    title: string;
    description: string;
    answers: {
      id: number;
      author: string;
      text: string;
    }[];
  };
}
```

This interface specifies that QuestionPageProps should have a question property that is an object with id, title, description, and answers properties. The id, title, and description properties are similar to the ones in the Question component. The answers property is an array of objects, where each object has an id property, an author property that specifies the author of the answer, and a text property that contains the text of the answer.
