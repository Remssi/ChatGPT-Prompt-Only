# Create React component that has user question as title and only the start of description

Sure, here's an example React component that takes a title prop representing the user's question and a description prop containing the full description of the question, but only displays the first 50 characters of the description:

jsx
Copy code

```
import React from 'react';

const Question = ({ title, description }) => {
  const truncatedDescription = description.slice(0, 50) + '...';

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{title}</h2>
      <p>{truncatedDescription}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Question;
```

You can use this component like this:

jsx
Copy code

```
<Question
  title="How do I learn React?"
  description="I'm new to React and I'm wondering what the best resources are for learning it. I've already read the official documentation, but I'm looking for more in-depth tutorials and examples."
/>
```

The output of this code will be a div containing an h2 with the text "How do I learn React?" and a p with the text "I'm new to React and I'm wondering what the best resources are for learning it. I've already read the official documentation, but I'm looking for more in-depth tutorials and examples..." (truncated to 50 characters followed by an ellipsis).
