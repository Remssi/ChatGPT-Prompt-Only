# Add comments to every component where you think it is useful

Sure, I can add comments to every component where I think it would be useful. Here is an example:

javascript
Copy code

```
import React from 'react';
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';

// This is the Header component which displays the app title and navigation links
const Header = () => {
  return (
    <header>
      <nav>
        {/* This is the app title */}
        <Link to="/" className="logo">My App</Link>

        {/* These are the navigation links */}
        <ul>
          <li><Link to="/ask">Ask a Question</Link></li>
          <li><Link to="/">Home</Link></li>
        </ul>
      </nav>
    </header>
  );
}

export default Header;
```

In this example, the comment above the component provides a brief description of what the component does, and the comments within the component indicate what each part of the component does. This can be helpful for other developers who may need to work with the code in the future, as well as for the original developer who may need to revisit the code after some time has passed.
