# Create that imported Home component, it should have pretty Header component, list of most recent questions and Footer component

Sure! Here's an example of how you could create a Home component with a header, list of recent questions, and footer:

tsx
Copy code

```
import React from 'react';
import Header from './Header';
import Footer from './Footer';
import Question from './Question';

interface HomeProps {
  questions: { id: number; title: string; description: string }[];
}

const Home: React.FC<HomeProps> = ({ questions }) => {
  const recentQuestions = questions.slice(0, 5);

  return (
    <div>
      <Header />

      <h2>Recent Questions</h2>
      {recentQuestions.map((question) => (
        <Question key={question.id} id={question.id} title={question.title} description={question.description} />
      ))}

      <Footer />
    </div>
  );
};

export default Home;
```

In this version, we've imported a Header component and a Footer component to surround the list of recent questions.

We've defined a HomeProps interface to specify that the Home component expects an array of questions that have an id, title, and description.

We've used the slice method to extract the first five recent questions from the questions array, and then used map to render a Question component for each one.

Finally, we've wrapped the Header, list of recent questions, and Footer components in a div element.
