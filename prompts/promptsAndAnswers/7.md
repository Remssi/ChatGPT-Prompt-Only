# Generate example HomeProps

Sure! Here's an example of what HomeProps might look like:

ts
Copy code

```
interface HomeProps {
  questions: {
    id: number;
    title: string;
    description: string;
  }[];
}
```

This interface specifies that HomeProps should have a questions property that is an array of objects with id, title, and description properties. Each id should be a number, and title and description should be strings.
