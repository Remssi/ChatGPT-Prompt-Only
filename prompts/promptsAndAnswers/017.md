# I want to color our components with following colors: #0B2447, #19376D and #576CBC

Sure! To apply the colors #0B2447, #19376D, and #576CBC to your components, you can use the backgroundColor CSS property. Here's an example of how you could update the Header component to use the first color:

tsx
Copy code

```
import React from 'react';

const Header: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <header style={{
      backgroundColor: '#0B2447',
      color: 'white',
      padding: '1rem',
      textAlign: 'center',
      marginBottom: 0,
    }}>
      <h1 style={{ margin: 0 }}>My Q&A App</h1>
    </header>
  );
};

export default Header;
```

We've added backgroundColor: '#0B2447' to the inline style of the header element. We've also added color: 'white' to ensure that the text is visible on the dark background.

You can apply the other colors to your components in the same way, by setting the backgroundColor property to the desired color value.
