# Make Question component clickable, so it redirects to that question's page

Sure, here's an example of how you could make the Question component clickable and have it redirect to a specific question's page:

tsx
Copy code

```
import React from 'react';
import { useHistory } from 'react-router-dom';

interface QuestionProps {
  id: number;
  title: string;
  description: string;
}

const Question: React.FC<QuestionProps> = ({ id, title, description }) => {
  const history = useHistory();

  const handleQuestionClick = () => {
    history.push(`/question/${id}`);
  };

  const truncatedDescription = description.slice(0, 50) + '...';

  return (
    <div onClick={handleQuestionClick} style={{ cursor: 'pointer' }}>
      <h2>{title}</h2>
      <p>{truncatedDescription}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Question;
```

In this version, we've added an id prop to uniquely identify the question. We've also imported the useHistory hook from react-router-dom to handle the navigation to the question's page.

We've added an onClick handler to the div that wraps the h2 and p elements. This handler calls history.push() to navigate to a specific URL based on the question's id.

Finally, we've added the style property to the div to change the cursor to a pointer, indicating that the element is clickable.
