# Make question component more like a card

Sure, to make the Question component look more like a card, you can add some box-shadow and padding to it. Here's an example of how you could update the styles:

css
Copy code

```
.Question {
  background-color: #FFFFFF;
  box-shadow: 0px 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  border-radius: 5px;
  padding: 1rem;
  margin-bottom: 1rem;
}
```

In this example, we've added a background-color of white, box-shadow to give it a slight drop-shadow effect, border-radius to round the corners, and padding to create some space around the content inside the component. We've also added margin-bottom to create some separation between Question components when they are displayed in a list.

You can add these styles to your Question.css file or add them directly to the style prop of the Question component.
