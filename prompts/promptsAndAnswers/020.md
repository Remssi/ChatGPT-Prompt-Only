# Make links orange

Sure! To make links orange, you can use the color CSS property and set it to the desired orange color value. Here's an example of how you could update the link styles in your application:

css
Copy code

```
a {
  color: #FFA500;
  text-decoration: none;
}
```

In this example, we're setting the color property of all a elements (links) to #FFA500, which is an orange color value. We've also added text-decoration: none to remove the default underline on links.

You can add this CSS rule to your index.css file, or you can add it to a separate CSS file and import it into your components where needed.
