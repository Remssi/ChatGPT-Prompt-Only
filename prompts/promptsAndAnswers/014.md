# No, I meant example data of actual value that is passed to QuestionPage component

Ah, I see! Here's an example of what the question prop might look like when it's passed to the QuestionPage component:

tsx
Copy code

```
const question = {
  id: 123,
  title: "What's the best way to learn React?",
  description: "I'm new to React and I'm not sure where to start. Any tips?",
  answers: [
    {
      id: 1,
      author: "John",
      text: "I recommend starting with the official React documentation. It's comprehensive and easy to follow.",
    },
    {
      id: 2,
      author: "Jane",
      text: "I found the React tutorial on the React website to be really helpful. It walks you through building a simple app step-by-step.",
    },
    {
      id: 3,
      author: "Bob",
      text: "I learned React by building a small app and googling for answers to my questions as I went along. It took longer, but I found it more rewarding.",
    },
  ],
};
```

This question object has an id of 123, a title of "What's the best way to learn React?", and a description of "I'm new to React and I'm not sure where to start. Any tips?". It also has an answers array with three objects, each representing an answer.
